    "Sure! Newton's theory of gravity describes gravity as a force that acts instantaneously between two objects with mass. It assumes that space and time are absolute and unchanging. On the other hand, general relativity describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by the presence of mass and energy. It assumes that space and time are not absolute, but are instead relative to the observer's frame of reference. \n",
